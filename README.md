## 1D

1D plane wave simulation with no boundaries at the ends of space (x=0mm and x=100mm). There is single 30 GHz source (infinite sheet) at the  middle of the grid (x=50mm).

1D plane wave simulation with no boundaries at the ends of space (x=0 and x=10). There is single 30 GHz source (infinite sheet) at the  middle of the grid (x=50). All the space to the left of x=40mm is filled with a material that has $\epsilon_r$ = 4 while everything to the right is free space.
